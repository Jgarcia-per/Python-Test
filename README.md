This repository is more meant to be a compilation type of tests that I usually do my day to day with Python. Don't expect to find large projects, more like sketches or things I need to understand before implementation in a much larger project, it doesn't necessarily mean that what you find here is why I implement it.

<h3 align="left">Virtual environments</h3>
The script used to create and manage virtual environments is ``pyvenv``.
``Pyvenv`` will normally install the most recent version of Python you have available; the script is also installed with a version number, so if you have multiple versions of Python on your system you can select a specific Python version by running ``python3`` or whichever version you want.
To create a virtual environment, follow the steps below:

* Open a terminal
* Locate in the folder where you need to create the virtual environment
* Run the following command to create a virtual environment
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv env
  ```
* Activate the virtual environment
  On Windows, run 
  ```bash
  env scripts activate
  ```
  On Unix or Mac OS, run 
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
